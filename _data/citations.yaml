  description: Static binary lifting is essential in binary rewriting frameworks.
    Existing tools overlook the impact of External Function Completion (EXFC) in static
    binary lifting. EXFC recovers the declarations of External Functions (EXFs, functions
    defined in standard shared libraries) using only the function symbols available.
    Incorrect EXFC can misinterpret the source binary, or cause memory overflows in
    static binary translation, which eventually results in program crashes. Notably,
    existing tools struggle to recover the declarations of mangled EXFs originating
    from binaries compiled from C++. Moreover, they require time-consuming manual
    processing to support new libraries. This paper presents EFACT, an External Function
    Auto-Completion Tool for static binary lifting. Our EXF recovery algorithm better
    recovers the declarations of mangled EXFs, particularly addressing the template
    specialization mechanism in C++. EFACT is designed as a lightweight plugin to
    strengthen other static binary rewriting frameworks in EXFC. Our evaluation shows
    that EFACT outperforms RetDec and McSema in mangled EXF recovery by 96.4% and
    97.3% on SPECrate 2017.Furthermore, we delve deeper into static binary translation
    and address several cross-ISA EXFC problems. When integrated with McSema, EFACT
    correctly translates 36.7% more benchmarks from x86-64 to x86-64 and 93.6% more
    from x86-64 to AArch64 than McSema alone on EEMBC.

- title: Efficient Cross-platform Multiplexing of Hardware Performance Counters via
    Adaptive Grouping

  description: "Collecting sufficient microarchitecture performance data is essential\
    \ for performance evaluation and workload characterization. There are many events\
    \ to be monitored in a modern processor while only a few hardware performance\
    \ monitoring counters (PMCs) can be used, so multiplexing is commonly adopted.\
    \ However, inefficiency commonly exists in state-of-the-art profiling tools when\
    \ grouping events for multiplexing PMCs. It has the risk of inaccurate measurement\
    \ and misleading analysis. Commercial tools can leverage PMCs, but they are closed\
    \ source and only support their specified platforms. To this end, we propose an\
    \ approach for efficient cross-platform microarchitecture performance measurement\
    \ via adaptive grouping, aiming to improve the metrics\u2019 sampling ratios.\
    \ The approach generates event groups based on the number of available PMCs detected\
    \ on arbitrary machines while avoiding the scheduling pitfall of Linux perf_event\
    \ subsystem. We evaluate our approach with SPEC CPU 2017 on four mainstream x86-64\
    \ and AArch64 processors and conduct comparative analyses of efficiency with two\
    \ other state-of-the-art tools, LIKWID and ARM Top-down Tool. The experimental\
    \ results indicate that our approach gains around 50% improvement in the average\
    \ sampling ratio of metrics without compromising the correctness and reliability."

  description: Busy-wait synchronization is often used for latency-critical applications
    to ensure low latency. Unfortunately, its performance bugs due to thread contention
    may lead to request failures or even system crashes. Localizing the performance
    bugs of busy-wait synchronization is not trivial because we have to pinpoint the
    exact moment of occurrence from a relatively long measurement period and simultaneously
    identify candidate busy-wait threads from numerous concurrent threads. Existing
    methods often rely on hotspot-driven analysis of lock-related functions, but they
    still need extensive manual work to localize busy-wait threads. This paper proposes
    timing call stack analysis (TCSA), an efficient approach to localizing busy-wait
    synchronization bugs. The key idea is to time-serialize the function call stacks
    of applications and identify consecutive identical call stacks to catch busy-wait
    threads. TCSA can handle any application regardless of its programming language
    and identify various busy-wait patterns, including spinlocks, chaining spinlocks,
    futexes, and safepoint checks within the Java Virtual Machine. Compared to the
    state-of-the-art, TCSA can effectively diminish the quantity of examined records
    (e.g., threads and functions) by 1 to 3 orders of magnitude. TCSA has been deployed
    to a large cloud service provider, demonstrating its effectiveness, efficiency,
    and practicality in four real latency-critical applications.

  description: With the proliferation of cloud computing, cloud service providers
    offer users a variety of choices in terms of pricing and computing performance.
    A critical factor impacting computing performance is main memory, often evaluated
    using bandwidth and access latency metrics. For two evaluations with the same
    workload while under different system configurations, it is hard to determine
    which system delivers better memory performance for the particular workload if
    neither evaluation data achieves higher bandwidth and lower latency simultaneously.
    This dilemma is further exacerbated under different memory access patterns. We
    recognize that state-of-the-art memory performance metrics cannot well address
    the dilemma. To address this challenge, we define a holistic memory performance
    metric, named *Hmem*, which is calculated from a fusion of bandwidth and latency
    metrics across different access patterns. To reflect the overall performance of
    a given workload, we calculate the correlation between our proposed metric and
    the workload's throughput. Experimental results show that Hmem exhibits an average
    improvement of 70% on correlation coefficients compared to state-of-the-art memory
    performance metrics. A large cloud service provider has adopted Hmem to improve
    the efficiency of their memory performance evaluation and cloud server selection.

  description: High-performance compilers play an important role in improving the
    run-time performance of a program, and it is hard and time-consuming to identify
    the key optimizations implemented in a high-performance compiler with traditional
    program analysis. In this paper, we propose a hotspot-driven semi-automated competitive
    analysis framework for identifying key optimizations through comparing the hotspot
    codes generated by any two different compilers. Our framework is platform-agnostic
    and works well on both AArch64 and X64 platforms, which automates the stages of
    hotspot detection and dynamic binary instrumentation only for selected hotspots.
    With the instrumented instruction characterization information, the framework
    users can analyze the binary code within a much smaller scope to explore practical
    optimizations implemented in any of the compilers compared. To demonstrate the
    effectiveness and practicality, we conduct experiments on SPECspeed 2017 Integer
    benchmarks(CINT2017) and their binaries generated by open-source GCC compiler
    versus proprietary Huawei BiSheng and Intel ICC compilers on AArch64 and X64 platforms
    respectively. Empirical studies show that our methods can identify several significant
    optimizations that have been implemented by proprietary compilers and as well
    can be implemented in open-source compilers. To Hangzhou Hongjun Microelectronics
    Technology(Hjmicro), the identified key optimizations shed great light on optimizing
    their GCC-based product compiler, which delivers 20.83% improvement for SPECrate
    2017 Integer on AArch64 platform.
