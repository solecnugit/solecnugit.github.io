  description: Understanding program runtime characteristics is crucial for tasks
    such as optimization and workload characterization. For long-running server-side
    workloads that execute as native binaries, effective profiling is essential to
    trace their complex runtime behaviors, enabling further optimizations to improve
    the reliability and efficiency of the delivered services. Widely adopted techniques
    for profiling these workloads include binary instrumentation and hardware-based
    profiling. Binary instrumentation is typically accurate but incurs high overhead
    and lacks flexibility for tracing long-running native workloads. Hardware-based
    profiling brings low overhead while requiring hardware support. To overcome these
    limitations, we present FlexInstru, a hardware-independent dynamic instrumentation
    framework based on the process attachment/detachment mechanism. FlexInstru can
    flexibly instrument a native application at any time and for any duration when
    the application is running, and achieve a good balance between instrumentation
    accuracy and overhead, which makes it particularly effective in tracing long-running
    native workloads.

  description: "Arm-based platforms have significant hardware fragmentation issues\
    \ due to the nature of Intellectual Property (IP) licensing. It is common for\
    \ hardware vendors to customize memory controllers. Conventional memory bandwidth\
    \ measurements based on memory controllers\u2019 performance monitoring units\
    \ (PMUs) face numerous obstacles, including the lack of kernel driver support\
    \ and official documentation. To this end, we lift the perspective to the more\
    \ general and upper level, i.e., the Network-on-Chip (NoC) level, instead of relying\
    \ on various customized memory controllers. We propose a unified method for measuring\
    \ memory bandwidth based on NoC traffic monitoring. Through a purely PMU-data-driven\
    \ detection, our method can automatically reveal the hidden physical locations\
    \ of memory controllers. By monitoring the upstream and downstream data traffic\
    \ of the ports where memory controllers are connected on the NoC, our method can\
    \ achieve accurate read and write memory bandwidth measurements without accessing\
    \ memory controller PMUs, thus achieving fragmentation harmonization. We summarize\
    \ all memory bandwidth methods currently applicable to Arm-based platforms and\
    \ conduct a systematical evaluation. The experimental results show that our proposed\
    \ method has an average error of 1.05% compared to the oracle answer, which can\
    \ serve as a generic method to measure memory bandwidth for Arm-based SoCs with\
    \ vendor-customized memory controllers."

  publisher: ACM Transactions on Architecture and Code Optimization
  description: "As the complexity of real-world server applications continues to grow,\
    \ performance optimizations for large-scale applications are becoming increasingly\
    \ challenging. The success of online optimization offered by OCOLOS and Dynimize\
    \ proves that binary rewriting based on edge profiling data can significantly\
    \ accelerate these applications. However, no similar online binary optimizer is\
    \ currently available on the AArch64 platform. In response to the growing adoption\
    \ of the AArch64 platform, this paper introduces AOBO, a fast-switching online\
    \ binary optimizer specifically designed for AArch64. In addition to providing\
    \ practical and efficient engineering support for AArch64-specific features, AOBO\
    \ overcomes the challenge of lacking hardware counters for edge profiling on most\
    \ commercially available AArch64 servers. In particular, AOBO embraces a novel\
    \ edge weight estimation scheme to deliver more accurate edge estimation, which\
    \ in turn allows AOBO\u2019s binary rewriter to generate more efficient code.\
    \ Furthermore, time spent on AOBO\u2019s online code replacement stage is optimized\
    \ to work at a subsecond level, thus enabling a fast switch from running the original\
    \ binary to run the optimized one. We evaluate AOBO with CINT2017, GCC, MySQL\
    \ and MongoDB, measuring the accuracy and coverage of the estimated edge weights,\
    \ the performance improvements of the optimized binaries, and the online optimization\
    \ cost. To make a fair comparison, we are using the performance data of the binaries\
    \ generated by the default compilation scripts in the software packages as a baseline.\
    \ Experimental data shows that AOBO can offer a more accurate edge weight estimation\
    \ and generate binaries with superior performance. Furthermore, AOBO achieves\
    \ online optimization with a very small overhead and significantly improves the\
    \ performance of large-scale applications. Compared with the baselines, AOBO\u2019\
    s online optimization can achieve 24.7% and 31.11% performance improvement respectively\
    \ for MySQL and MongoDB. Notably, application pause time is reduced from 1599.8\
    \ milliseconds to 462.1 milliseconds for MySQL, and from 1765.9 milliseconds to\
    \ 507.1 milliseconds for MongoDB."

  publisher: IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems
  description: 'The paper focuses on an understudied yet fundamental problem: existing
    methods typically average the utilization of multiple hardware threads to evaluate
    the available CPU resources. However, the approach could underestimate the actual
    usage of the underlying physical core for Simultaneous Multi-Threading (SMT) processors,
    leading to an overestimation of remaining resources. The overestimation propagates
    from microarchitecture to operating systems and cloud schedulers, which may misguide
    scheduling decisions, exacerbate CPU overcommitment, and increase Service Level
    Agreement (SLA) violations. To address the potential overestimation problem, we
    propose an SMT-aware and purely data-driven approach named Remaining CPU (RCPU)
    that reserves more CPU resources to restrict CPU overcommitment and prevent SLA
    violations. RCPU requires only a few modifications to the existing cloud infrastructures
    and can be scaled up to large data centers. Extensive evaluations in the data
    center proved that RCPU contributes to a reduction of SLA violations by 18% on
    average for 98% of all latency-sensitive applications. Under a benchmarking experiment,
    we prove that RCPU increases the accuracy by 69% in terms of Mean Absolute Error
    (MAE) compared to the state-of-the-art'

  description: Software deployment misconfiguration often happens and has been one
    of the major causes of deployment failures that give rise to service interruptions.
    However, there is currently no existing approach to automatically repairing deployment
    failures. We propose DeployFix, which automatically repairs software deployment
    failures via constraint solving in the dynamic-changing deployment environments.
    DeployFix first defines DeployIR as a unified intermediate representation to achieve
    the translation of heterogeneous specifications from different schedulers with
    different syntaxes. By reducing the root-cause analysis of deployment failures
    to the conflict resolution in propositional logic, DeployFix uses off-the-shelf
    constraint solvers to achieve automatic localization and diagnosis of conflicting
    constraints, which are the root causes of deployment failures. DeployFix finally
    resolves the conflicting constraints and generates repaired deployment configurations
    in terms of practical requirements. We evaluate DeployFix in both simulation and
    production environments with tens of thousands of nodes at Alibaba, on which tens
    of thousands of applications are running guided by hundreds of thousands of deployment
    constraints. Experimental results demonstrate that DeployFix outperforms the state
    of the art and it correctly repairs the deployment failures in minutes, even in
    a large production data center.

  description: Static binary lifting is essential in binary rewriting frameworks.
    Existing tools overlook the impact of External Function Completion (EXFC) in static
    binary lifting. EXFC recovers the declarations of External Functions (EXFs, functions
    defined in standard shared libraries) using only the function symbols available.
    Incorrect EXFC can misinterpret the source binary, or cause memory overflows in
    static binary translation, which eventually results in program crashes. Notably,
    existing tools struggle to recover the declarations of mangled EXFs originating
    from binaries compiled from C++. Moreover, they require time-consuming manual
    processing to support new libraries. This paper presents EFACT, an External Function
    Auto-Completion Tool for static binary lifting. Our EXF recovery algorithm better
    recovers the declarations of mangled EXFs, particularly addressing the template
    specialization mechanism in C++. EFACT is designed as a lightweight plugin to
    strengthen other static binary rewriting frameworks in EXFC. Our evaluation shows
    that EFACT outperforms RetDec and McSema in mangled EXF recovery by 96.4% and
    97.3% on SPECrate 2017.Furthermore, we delve deeper into static binary translation
    and address several cross-ISA EXFC problems. When integrated with McSema, EFACT
    correctly translates 36.7% more benchmarks from x86-64 to x86-64 and 93.6% more
    from x86-64 to AArch64 than McSema alone on EEMBC.

    Adaptive Grouping

  type: paper
  publisher: ACM Transactions on Architecture and Code Optimization
  description: "Collecting sufficient microarchitecture performance data is essential\
    \ for performance evaluation and workload characterization. There are many events\
    \ to be monitored in a modern processor while only a few hardware performance\
    \ monitoring counters (PMCs) can be used, so multiplexing is commonly adopted.\
    \ However, inefficiency commonly exists in state-of-the-art profiling tools when\
    \ grouping events for multiplexing PMCs. It has the risk of inaccurate measurement\
    \ and misleading analysis. Commercial tools can leverage PMCs, but they are closed\
    \ source and only support their specified platforms. To this end, we propose an\
    \ approach for efficient cross-platform microarchitecture performance measurement\
    \ via adaptive grouping, aiming to improve the metrics\u2019 sampling ratios.\
    \ The approach generates event groups based on the number of available PMCs detected\
    \ on arbitrary machines while avoiding the scheduling pitfall of Linux perf_event\
    \ subsystem. We evaluate our approach with SPEC CPU 2017 on four mainstream x86-64\
    \ and AArch64 processors and conduct comparative analyses of efficiency with two\
    \ other state-of-the-art tools, LIKWID and ARM Top-down Tool. The experimental\
    \ results indicate that our approach gains around 50% improvement in the average\
    \ sampling ratio of metrics without compromising the correctness and reliability."

  description: Busy-wait synchronization is often used for latency-critical applications
    to ensure low latency. Unfortunately, its performance bugs due to thread contention
    may lead to request failures or even system crashes. Localizing the performance
    bugs of busy-wait synchronization is not trivial because we have to pinpoint the
    exact moment of occurrence from a relatively long measurement period and simultaneously
    identify candidate busy-wait threads from numerous concurrent threads. Existing
    methods often rely on hotspot-driven analysis of lock-related functions, but they
    still need extensive manual work to localize busy-wait threads. This paper proposes
    timing call stack analysis (TCSA), an efficient approach to localizing busy-wait
    synchronization bugs. The key idea is to time-serialize the function call stacks
    of applications and identify consecutive identical call stacks to catch busy-wait
    threads. TCSA can handle any application regardless of its programming language
    and identify various busy-wait patterns, including spinlocks, chaining spinlocks,
    futexes, and safepoint checks within the Java Virtual Machine. Compared to the
    state-of-the-art, TCSA can effectively diminish the quantity of examined records
    (e.g., threads and functions) by 1 to 3 orders of magnitude. TCSA has been deployed
    to a large cloud service provider, demonstrating its effectiveness, efficiency,
    and practicality in four real latency-critical applications.

  description: With the proliferation of cloud computing, cloud service providers
    offer users a variety of choices in terms of pricing and computing performance.
    A critical factor impacting computing performance is main memory, often evaluated
    using bandwidth and access latency metrics. For two evaluations with the same
    workload while under different system configurations, it is hard to determine
    which system delivers better memory performance for the particular workload if
    neither evaluation data achieves higher bandwidth and lower latency simultaneously.
    This dilemma is further exacerbated under different memory access patterns. We
    recognize that state-of-the-art memory performance metrics cannot well address
    the dilemma. To address this challenge, we define a holistic memory performance
    metric, named *Hmem*, which is calculated from a fusion of bandwidth and latency
    metrics across different access patterns. To reflect the overall performance of
    a given workload, we calculate the correlation between our proposed metric and
    the workload's throughput. Experimental results show that Hmem exhibits an average
    improvement of 70% on correlation coefficients compared to state-of-the-art memory
    performance metrics. A large cloud service provider has adopted Hmem to improve
    the efficiency of their memory performance evaluation and cloud server selection.

  description: High-performance compilers play an important role in improving the
    run-time performance of a program, and it is hard and time-consuming to identify
    the key optimizations implemented in a high-performance compiler with traditional
    program analysis. In this paper, we propose a hotspot-driven semi-automated competitive
    analysis framework for identifying key optimizations through comparing the hotspot
    codes generated by any two different compilers. Our framework is platform-agnostic
    and works well on both AArch64 and X64 platforms, which automates the stages of
    hotspot detection and dynamic binary instrumentation only for selected hotspots.
    With the instrumented instruction characterization information, the framework
    users can analyze the binary code within a much smaller scope to explore practical
    optimizations implemented in any of the compilers compared. To demonstrate the
    effectiveness and practicality, we conduct experiments on SPECspeed 2017 Integer
    benchmarks(CINT2017) and their binaries generated by open-source GCC compiler
    versus proprietary Huawei BiSheng and Intel ICC compilers on AArch64 and X64 platforms
    respectively. Empirical studies show that our methods can identify several significant
    optimizations that have been implemented by proprietary compilers and as well
    can be implemented in open-source compilers. To Hangzhou Hongjun Microelectronics
    Technology(Hjmicro), the identified key optimizations shed great light on optimizing
    their GCC-based product compiler, which delivers 20.83% improvement for SPECrate
    2017 Integer on AArch64 platform.
